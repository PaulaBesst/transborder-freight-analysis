# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ US-Canada-Mexico Transborder Freight Analysis

This project explores, cleans, and analyzes the **Transborder Freight Dataset** to derive insights on goods movement by different transport modes (truck, rail, air, pipeline, vessel) across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. The final outcome is a minimal, modern Power BI dashboard presenting the key findings visually.

## Objectives

- Understand and transform the raw Transborder Freight data
- Extract and analyze monthly freight movement patterns
- Compare shipment values by transport mode and country
- Visualize trends through Power BI with interactive filters

## Tools and Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy)
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
- Git & GitHub

## Key Insights

- Monthly shipment values are highest in [Insert month after analysis]
- The U.S. trades most by **truck** followed by **rail**
- [Insert more if needed]

## How to Use

1. Clone this repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/paulabesst/transborder-freight-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the folder  
   ```bash
   cd transborder-freight-analysis
   ```

3. Install dependencies  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Python analysis  
   ```bash
   python freight_analysis.py
   ```

5. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop to explore the dashboard
